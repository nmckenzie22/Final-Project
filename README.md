## Introduction

As data science students, we often look to data as a tool to illuminate persistent inequalities and uncover meaningful patterns that shape our society. In the United States, the connection between education and economic prosperity is frequently assumed to be direct and causal. Higher levels of education are believed to lead to higher incomes, better employment opportunities, and improved quality of life. But is this relationship as straightforward as it seems?

The U.S. education system is vast and varied, with counties across the country showing significant differences in degree attainment. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, educational attainment is one of the strongest predictors of economic mobility, but disparities in access to quality education remain a pressing issue. Rural counties, in particular, often face systemic barriers to both higher education and high-paying jobs. Understanding how education levels correlate with income at the county level is essential to evaluating the effectiveness of education policy and identifying communities that may be underserved.

At the same time, it is important to recognize that income is shaped by more than just education. Local industries, cost of living, historical inequality, and regional infrastructure also play key roles. While one county may see high earnings with modest degree attainment due to a dominant industry, another may struggle economically despite high educational levels. This complexity raises an important question: How strongly does educational attainment, specifically the percentage of residents with associate or bachelor’s degrees,predict per capita income across U.S. counties?

To explore this, we analyzed a dataset that includes income data from 2019 to 2021 and education statistics spanning from 2015 to 2020. By comparing these variables across hundreds of U.S. counties, we aim to assess whether patterns exist that can help explain economic outcomes through the lens of higher education. While this study is limited to quantitative correlations, it can serve as a starting point for understanding how educational investment might influence local economies and where such investment may have the greatest impact.

Ultimately, our goal is to test whether increasing educational attainment truly aligns with increased personal income—and to consider what this relationship implies for regional policy, resource allocation, and long-term economic development in the United States.
